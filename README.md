# 👋 Hi, I’m **Fahad S. Ahmed, MD**

## **Technical Profile (Bioinformatics-Focused Version)**

I am a physician–scientist specializing in **hematopathology**, **molecular diagnostics**, and **computational oncology**. My work focuses on developing **robust, interpretable machine learning pipelines** for biomarker discovery, clinical outcome prediction, and multi-omic integration across hematologic malignancies.

### 🧠 Technical Focus
- Statistical learning & ensemble models (RF, GBM, SVM, Cox models, survival ensembles)  
- High-throughput transcriptomics & proteomics (RNA-seq, microarrays, NanoString, GeoMx DSP)  
- Platform-aware normalization and cross-study harmonization (limma, edgeR, sva, batch correction)  
- Clinical data modeling: treatment response, progression-free survival, prognostic signatures  
- Digital pathology (WSI processing, feature extraction, spatial profiling)

### 🧬 Current Projects
- Multi-study harmonization pipelines for lymphoid malignancies (NCBI GEO / ArrayExpress)  
- Spatial proteogenomic integration using GeoMx DSP  
- Machine-learning models for risk prediction in DLBCL, MZL, and CLL  
- CLIA-aligned workflows for molecular diagnostics and biomarker validation  

### 🤝 Collaboration Interests
- Computational hematopathology  
- ML/AI for clinical diagnostics  
- Large-scale multi-omic datasets  
- Translational biomarker discovery  

### 🤝 **Collaboration**
Open to collaborations in hematologic malignancies, translational pathology and machine learning.
