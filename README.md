I am a physician–scientist with training in hematopathology, molecular pathology, and computational oncology. My work focuses on developing reproducible machine learning and multi-omic analysis pipelines for biomarker discovery, clinical outcome prediction, and cross-platform dataset harmonization. I routinely work with transcriptomic, proteomic, and spatial profiling technologies and build workflows that integrate biological structure with clinically interpretable modeling.

My research interests include computational hematopathology, multi-study data integration, survival modeling, and translational biomarker development in lymphoid malignancies. Current projects involve large-scale mining of public datasets (GEO, TCGA), spatial proteogenomic analysis, and development of diagnostic or prognostic signatures applicable to clinical workflows.

I welcome collaborations involving clinical or biological outcome prediction, computational pathology, and multi-omic integration. I primarily work in R and Python, with an emphasis on transparent, well-documented, and reproducible pipelines.
